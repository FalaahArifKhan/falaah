										<p><strong>Hi! I'm Falaah.</strong> I'm a Engineer/Scientist by training and an Artist by nature, broadly interested in Reliable and Responsible AI. Towards this end, I conduct fundamental research on Robust Deep Learning, Fairness in Machine Learning and AI Ethics and create scientific comics (and other technical art) to disseminate the nuances of this work in a way that is more democratic and accessible to the general public.

										I'm currently an Artist-in-Residence at the <a href="http://airesponsibly.com/"> Center for Responsible AI at NYU </a>. I'm extremely lucky to get to do two things I absolutely love to do: fundamental research and creating scientific comics!
 
										<p>At NYU, I run the <a href="https://dataresponsibly.github.io/comics/"> 'Data, Responsibly' Comic series </a>, along with <a href="http://stoyanovich.org/"> Prof Julia Stoyanovich </a>. We just released our second volume <a href="https://dataresponsibly.github.io/comics/vol2/fairness_en.pdf">'Fairness and Friends' </a>on bias in algorithmic systems, fairness in machine learning and broader doctrines of equality of opportunity and justice from political philosophy.

										<p>Volume 1, titled <a href="https://dataresponsibly.github.io/comics/vol1/mirror_en.pdf"> 'Mirror, Mirror'</a>, dealt with questions such as <i> What work are we funding? Who are we building models for? What problems are we solving? </i> We delved into Digital accessibility and the impact of poorly designed systems on marginalized demographics and tied together these insights with broader issues in the Machine Learning landscape including problems with operationalizing fairness, misguided incentive structures in scholarship, exclusionary discourse and questions of culpability when things go wrong.
										
										<p>I also run the <a href="https://github.com/acmi-lab/superheroes-deep-learning">'Superheroes of Deep Learning'</a> comic series with <a href="http://zacklipton.com/">Prof Zack Lipton</a>, which documents the thrilling tales and heroic feats of ML's larger-than-life champions.
										
										<p>I recently finished an Artist Residency at the Montreal AI Ethics Institute. My visual essay, <a href="https://ai-ethics.github.io/decoded-reality/intro.html"> 'Decoded Reality'</a>, is an artistic exploration of the power dynamics that shape the design, development and deployment of ML systems. We present visual interpretations of how algorithmic interventions manifest in society, with the hope of provoking the designers of these systems to think critically about the socio-political underpinnings of each step of the engineering process.

										<p>Previously, I worked as a Research Engineer at Dell EMC, Bangalore where I designed and built data-driven models for Identity and Access Management (IAM). My research focused on behavior-based Authentication, online learning for CAPTCHA design and (Graph) Signal Processing for Dynamic Threat Modelling. </p>
										
										<p>My work in the industry showed me firsthand the pressing challenges of building 'production-ready' models. Contrary to the media narrative around AI, we are yet to have figured out how to build models that are robust, trustworthy and designed to thrive in the wild. These challenges have informed my interest to explore the foundations of generalization, robustness and fairness, and to translate these insights into algorithms with provable guarantees. I’m also interested in critically assessing how AI impacts, and is in turn impacted by, the underlying social setting in which it was formulated. </p>

										      		<p> Recent interest in codifying fairness in Automated Decision Systems (ADS) has resulted in a wide range of formulations of what it means for an algorithm to be “fair.” Most of these propositions are inspired by, but inadequately grounded in, scholarship from political philosophy. This work aims to correct that deficit. We critically evaluate different definitions of fairness as Equality of Opportunity (EOP) by contrasting their conception in political philosophy (such as Rawls’s fair EOP and formal EOP) with the proposed codification in Fair-ML (such as statistical parity, equality of odds and accuracy) to provide a clearer lens with which to view existing results and to identify future research directions. We use this framing to reinterpret the impossibility results as the incompatibility between different EOP doctrines and demonstrate how political philosophy can provide normative guidance as to which notion of fairness is applicable in which context. We conclude by highlighting justice considerations that the fair-ML literature currently overlooks or underemphasizes, such as Rawls's broader theory of justice, which supplements his EOP principle with a principle guaranteeing equal rights and liberties to all citizens in a free and democratic society. </p>

										      		<p>The fundamental research problem was to investigate the efficacy of a novel “who I am/how I behave” authentication paradigm. Conventional authentication works on a “what I know” (username/password) or “what I have” (device) model. Our system would study the user’s behavior while typing his/her username and use the activity profile as the key against which access was granted. This eliminated the need for the user to remember a password or have access to a registered device. Conversely, even if a password is cracked or a device is stolen, the bad actor would not be able to penetrate the system because his behavior would intrinsically differ from that of the genuine user.</p>

									            	<p>CAPTCHAs, short for Complete Automated Public Turing Tests to tell Computers and Humans Apart, have been around since 2003 as the simplest human-user identification test. They can be understood as Reverse Turing Tests because in solving a CAPTCHA challenge it is a human subject that is appearing to prove his/her human-ness to a computer program. </p>
									            	<p> Over the years we have seen CAPTCHA challenges evolve from being a string of characters for the user to decipher, to be an image selection challenge, to being as simple as ticking a checkbox. As each new CAPTCHA scheme hits the market, it is inevitably followed with research on new techniques to break these challenges. Engineers must then go back to the drawing board and design a new and more secure CAPTCHA scheme, which, upon deployment and subsequent use, is again, inadvertently subject to adversarial scrutiny. This arduous cycle of designing, breaking and then redesigning to strengthen against subsequent breaking, has become the de-facto lifecycle of a secure CAPTCHA scheme. This beckons the question; Are our CAPTCHAs truly “Completely Automated”? Is the labor involved in designing each new secure scheme outweighed by the speed with which a suitable adversary can be designed? Is the fantasy of creating a truly automated reverse Turing test dead? </p>
									            	<p> Reminding ourselves of why we count CAPTCHAs as such an essential tool in our security toolbox, we characterize CAPTCHAs in a robustness-user experience-feasibility trichotomy. With such a characterization, we introduce a novel framework that leverages Adversarial Learning and Human-in-the-Loop, Bayesian Inference to design CAPTCHAs schemes that are truly automated. We apply our framework to character CAPTCHAs and show that it does in fact generate a scheme that steadily moves closer to our design objectives of maximizing robustness while maintaining user experience and minimizing allocated resources, without requiring manual redesigning. </p>

									            	<p>Threat modelling is the process of identifying vulnerabilities in an application. The standard practice of threat modelling today involves drawing out the architecture of the product and then looking at the structure and nature of calls being made and determining which components could be vulnerable to which kinds of attacks.</p>
									            	<p>Threat modelling is an extremely important step in the software development lifecycle, but emerging practice shows that teams usually only construct and evaluate the threat model before deploying the application. Industrial offerings also cater to this approach, by designing tools that generate static models, suitable for one-time reference. The major drawback in this approach is that a software is not a static entity and is subject to dynamic changes in form of incremental feature enhancements and routine re-design for optimization. Threat modelling, hence, should also be imparted the same dynamism and our work attempts to enable this. </p>
									            	<p> Application logs are used to model the product as a weighted directed graph, where vertices are code elements and edges indicate function calls between elements. Unsupervised learning models are used to set edge weights as indicators of vulnerability to a specific attack. Graph filters are then created and nodes that pass through the filter form the vulnerable subgraph. Superimposing all the vulnerable subgraphs with respect to the different attacks gives rise to a threat model, which is dynamic in nature and evolves as the product grows. </p>
